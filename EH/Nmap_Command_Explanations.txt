Nmap Commands and Their Explanations

1. ACK Scan (-sA)
Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org
Purpose: Used to map firewall rulesets and determine whether ports are filtered or unfiltered.
How it works: Sends TCP packets with the ACK flag set. If RST is received, the port is unfiltered.
If no response or ICMP unreachable error is received, the port is filtered.
It does NOT determine if a port is open.

2. SYN Scan (-sS)
Command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org
Purpose: Performs a stealth scan to detect open ports without completing the TCP handshake.
How it works: Sends a SYN packet. If SYN-ACK is received, port is open. If RST is received, it's closed.
It does not send ACK back, making it less likely to be logged.

3. FIN Scan (-sF)
Command: nmap -sF -T4 target
Purpose: Detects open ports by sending packets with the FIN flag set.
How it works: Closed ports send RST. Open ports ignore the FIN packet.
Effective on non-Windows systems and can bypass some firewalls.

4. NULL Scan (-sN)
Command: nmap -sN -p22 scanme.nmap.org
Purpose: Sends TCP packets with no flags set to evade firewalls and IDS.
How it works: Closed ports send RST; open ports do not respond.
Works best on UNIX-based systems.

5. XMAS Scan (-sX)
Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org
Purpose: Sends TCP packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set.
How it works: Closed ports respond with RST; open ports ignore.
Used to evade intrusion detection systems and analyze firewalls.

Note: FIN, NULL, and XMAS scans are primarily useful on UNIX-like systems and are not reliable on Windows.
